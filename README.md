# RSA-Fctoring-Challenge

**RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. It is also one of the oldest.**

HTTPS uses Secure Socket Layer to encrypt data that is transferred between client and server. SSL uses the RSA algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem), an asymmetric encryption technology. The precise details of how the algorithm works is complex, but basically it leverages the fact that whilst multiplying two large prime numbers together is easy, factoring the result back into the constituent primes is very, very hard.

Prime Factorization (or integer factorization) is a commonly used mathematical problem often used to secure public-key encryption systems. A common practice is to use very large semi-primes (that is, the result of the multiplication of two prime numbers) as the number securing the encryption. In order to break it, they would have to find the prime factorization of the large semi-prime number – that is, two or more **prime numbers** that multiplied together result in the original number.

The RSA algorithm is a public-key cryptosystem. This means that there are two keys, a public key, and a private key. The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encryption. The private key is known only by the owner and is used for decryption. The RSA algorithm is asymmetric, which means that the encryption and decryption keys are different.

The RSA algorithm is based on the fact that it is very difficult to factorize large numbers. The security of the RSA algorithm, therefore, depends on the fact that the factorization of large numbers is a difficult problem.
